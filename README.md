WigiiÂ® is a web based software allowing management of any kind of data (contacts, documents, calendar, and any custom type). Very good user access control through roles, users, and access rights at folder level. Data can be filtered, imported from csv, exported in csv, xml, Excel, and of course do any CRUD (create, read, update, delete) function. Data schemas are defined in XML configuration files. This XML configuration gives the opportunity to customize fully how you want the system to interact with your data.
